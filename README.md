## Introduction
This is a recommendation system implemented in C++. The system utilizes a collaborative filtering algorithm to provide personalized recommendations based on user ratings. The code is designed to read input data from text files and output the recommendations in a CSV file.

## Features

- Predicts user ratings for items based on similar users' ratings.
- Customizable parameters for the number of users, items, and top user count.
- Input data is read from text files, and recommendations are written to a CSV file.

## Requirements
To run the recommendation system, you need:
- C++ compiler
- Development environment or IDE

## Installation
1. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone 
   $ cd 
   ```
2. Open the source code file recommendation_system.cpp in a C++ development environment.
3. Modify the necessary constants in the code according to your data.
4. Build and run the code.
